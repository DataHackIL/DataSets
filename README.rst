DataSets by `DataHack <http://datahack-il.com/>`_
#################################################

A curated list of cool open datasets to use in machine learning driven projects.

Brought to you by `DataHack <http://datahack-il.com/>`_, a data-driven hackathon. You can also find us on `Facebook <https://www.facebook.com/datahackil/>`_, `Meeutp <https://www.meetup.com/DataHack>`_, `Twitter <https://twitter.com/DataHackIL/>`_ and join `our monthly newsletter <http://us12.campaign-archive2.com/home/?u=de6927f58980fe1c8f3b78cf7&id=d70a19b217>`_. 

The list starts with unique Israeli open public datasets, from governmental organizations and other public instituitions, collected and maintained by `The Public Knowledge Workshop <http://www.hasadna.org.il/en/>`_ - one of `DataHack <http://datahack-il.com/>`_'s major partners. We then continue the list with open datasets from a variety of sources.

This list is open, and contributions are both welcomed and encouraged. To contribute to the list, simply edit this ``README.rst`` file to add an entry in the existing format and create a pull request. To keep in line with the designation of this list as an inspiration for machine learning driven projects (in hackathons and in general), please make sure to include a short description of the dataset, a link where the data is available and a few project suggestions. Additions to existing entries are also welcomed.

Open Israeli Municipal Budgets üèò
=================================

**Description:** Open local budget is a project under The Public Knowledge Workshop aimed at making local authorities budgets accessible to the public. While the project is at beta, many budgets are already online (some in a more accessible format than others) and browsable, though only a single budget can be viewed at a time, in the `project's home page <http://www.omuni.org/>`_. Being in beta means that there is plenty of room for improvement - this is where you can come in!

**Project ideas:** 

- How can we compare between budgets of different municipalities or of the same municipality but in different years? And how can such a comparison be visualized?
- Given a budget can we understand how it is invested geographically/demographically? Moreover, can we derive how a given municipality invests the money it got from taxes/arnona in proportion to the amount payed by each region in the city?
- Generalize the above two ideas into a tool that is able to take complex queries and produce meaningful results (not necesarily visualized).


Israeli Knesset members' Facebook posts and comments üèõ
=======================================================

**Description:** We provide a unique dataset of facebook comments to statuses published by Israeli MKs during 2015-2016. In total there are about 5 million such comments, out of which 1,600 are labeled according to the sentiment of the comment's text. A great challenge is to use the 1,600 labeled comments, in order to find the sentiment of all the comments. In the linked folder you'll find the labeled data, some information about the labels, and the unlabeled data. This dataset was collected by the team of `Kikar Hamedina <https://kikar.org/>`_, and they will be more than happy to help. 

**Link:** https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bz-MJkSVg93LaXRFRkdJckYtV0E

**Project ideas:** 

- What type of posts and subjects elicit the most responses?
- How to different Knesset Members differ in the way they communicate with their audience? Think of ways to visualize the difference in frequency, content, amount of feedback and other interesting parameters.
- Are Knesset Members' posts a place of discussion and communication with our representatives? Do they respond to questions? Do later posts refer to their followers' reactions, questions and concerns?


Pok√©api - The Pok√©mon RESTful API ‚úä
====================================

**Description:** Pok√©mon started out as a Japanese card game and became a worldwide phenomenom. The link is to a public API providing access to all the information about all Pok√©mons, throughout all existing (seven) generations + including berries! 

**Link:** http://pokeapi.co

**Project ideas:** 

- A bot that you could compete against.
- A bot that could help you train your Pok√©mons.

**Additional resources:** 

- `Pok√©dex Python module <https://github.com/veekun/pokedex>`_ - The name says it all.
- `The Pok√©dex <https://pokemondb.net/pokedex>`_ - A website holding all information about Pok√©mon, they have no public API (as far as we could tell), but you can scrape it for info.


Reddit comments üí¨
==================

**Description:** A constantly updated dataset of *every* comment posted on reddit since the site's inception in 2005, totalling at more than 1.7 *billion* comments. You can read about the origin of the dataset `here <https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7/i_have_every_publicly_available_reddit_comment/>`_, and about the way it is stored in Google BigQuery `here <https://www.reddit.com/r/bigquery/comments/3cej2b/17_billion_reddit_comments_loaded_on_bigquery/>`_.

**Link:** https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/dataset/fh-bigquery:reddit_comments

**Project ideas:** 

- What makes a reddit comment popular (i.e. get a high score)? Find correlation to time posted and content: Do late comments still have a chance to be popular? Do short comments fair better than long ones? Are there any specific words or terms that boost a post's score?
- Automatically generate an average, or a popular, reddit comment given a reddit link and the comments already posted on its thread.
- Find correlation between real world events and reddit comments: What events do the reddit community respond to more? What types of events elicit a quick but short response and what types bring about a long response continuing for days or weeks?


Stack Exchange üî∑
==================

**Description:** Starting in Stack-Overflow, the Stack-Exchange network is a collection of Q&A websites, each dealing with a different topic - from porgramming to home improvement. These vast knowledge bases, some containing over a few millions of answers, are available to download in XML format. 

**Link:** https://archive.org/details/stackexchange 

**Project ideas:** 

- How many questions are unique? We believe that most questions have been answered before (in some form or another) so why not develop an automated answering system?
- Could we teach a machine to code based on answers from Stack-Overflow?
- Is there similarity between different sites relating to similar topics? For instance, do questions asked around Latin-based languages have a similar answer?
