Open Israeli Municipal Budgets üèò
=================================

**Description:** Open local budget is a project under The Public Knowledge Workshop aimed at making local authorities budgets accessible to the public. While the project is at beta, many budgets are already online (some in a more accessible format than others) and browsable, though only a single budget can be viewed at a time, in the `project's home page <http://www.omuni.org/>`_. Being in beta means that there is plenty of room for improvement - this is where you can come in!

**Project ideas:** 

- How can we compare between budgets of different municipalities or of the same municipality but in different years? And how can such a comparison be visualized?
- Given a budget can we understand how it is invested geographically/demographically? Moreover, can we derive how a given municipality invests the money it got from taxes/arnona in proportion to the amount payed by each region in the city?
- Generalize the above two ideas into a tool that is able to take complex queries and produce meaningful results (not necesarily visualized).


Pok√©api - The Pok√©mon RESTful API ‚úä
====================================

**Description:** Pok√©mon started out as a Japanese card game and became a worldwide phenomenom. The link is to a public API providing access to all the information about all Pok√©mons, throughout all existing (seven) generations + including berries! 

**Link:** http://pokeapi.co

**Project ideas:** 

- A bot that you could compete against.
- A bot that could help you train your Pok√©mons.

**Additional resources:** 

 - `Pok√©dex Python module <https://github.com/veekun/pokedex>`_ - The name says it all.
 - `The Pok√©dex <https://pokemondb.net/pokedex>`_ - A website holding all information about Pok√©mon, they have no public API (as far as we could tell), but you can scrape it for info.
