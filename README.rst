Open Israeli Municipal Budgets üèò
=================================

**Description:** Open local budget is a project under The Public Knowledge Workshop aimed at making local authorities budgets accessible to the public. While the project is at beta, many budgets are already online (some in a more accessible format than others) and browsable, though only a single budget can be viewed at a time, in the `project's home page <http://www.omuni.org/>`_. Being in beta means that there is plenty of room for improvement - this is where you can come in! 

**Link:** https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9KCjEIdzJZUSUF2NVRaNW9JYTg?sort=7&direction=d

**Project ideas:** 

- How can we compare between budgets of different municipalities or of the same municipality but in different years? And how can such a comparison be visualized?
- Given a budget can we understand how it is invested geographically/demographically? Moreover, can we derive how a given municipality invests the money it got from taxes/arnona in proportion to the amount payed by each region in the city?
- Generalize the above two ideas into a tool that is able to take complex queries and produce meaningful results (not necesarily visualized).


Israeli Knesset members' Facebook posts and comments üèõ
=======================================================

**Description:** We provide a unique dataset of facebook comments to statuses published by Israeli MKs during 2015-2016. In total there are about 5 million such comments, out of which 1,600 are labeled according to the sentiment of the comment's text. A great challenge is to use the 1,600 labeled comments, in order to find the sentiment of all the comments. In the linked folder you'll find the labeled data, some information about the labels, and the unlabeled data. This dataset was collected by the team of `Kikar Hamedina <https://kikar.org/>`_, and they will be more than happy to help. 

**Link:** https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bz-MJkSVg93LaXRFRkdJckYtV0E

**Project ideas:** 

- What type of posts and subjects elicit the most responses?
- How to different Knesset Members differ in the way they communicate with their audience? Think of ways to visualize the difference in frequency, content, amount of feedback and other interesting parameters.
- Are Knesset Members' posts a place of discussion and communication with our representatives? Do they respond to questions? Do later posts refer to their followers' reactions, questions and concerns?


PRO-ACT: Pooled Resource Open-Access ALS Clinical Trials Database üî¨
====================================================================

**Description:** Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a specific disease that causes the death of neurons which control voluntary muscles. The cause is not known in 90% to 95% of cases. No cure for ALS is known. The `PRO-ACT initiative <https://nctu.partners.org/ProAct/>`_ provides users with easy access to

- Over 10,700 fully de-identified clinical ALS patient records.
- Placebo and treatment-arm data from 23 Phase II/III clinical trials.
- Demographic, lab, medical and family history, and other data elements.
- More than 10 million longitudinally collected data points.

**Link:** https://nctu.partners.org/ProAct/Data/Index

**Project ideas:** 

- *Cause:* The cause of ALS is not known in 90% to 95% of cases, and besides a genetic cause in a small percentage of the cases various environmental factors are suspected. This dataset can be used to investigate the statistical significance of various suggested causes and suggest possible new ones.
- *Diagnosis:* Dignosis of ALS is challenging, and is based on a person's signs and symptoms with testing done to rule out other potential causes. Using the dataset to suggest statistical significance of the connnection of different symptoms and suggesting possible new ones can be extremely valuable to improve diagnosis of ALS.
- *Identify meaningful subgroups:* `The ALS Stratification Challenge <https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2873386/wiki/>`_ utilizes the PRO-ACT database, as well as data from the Irish National ALS register and The Piemonte and Valle d'Aosta Register for ALS. It asks solvers to identify meaningful sub-groups of ALS patients. Challenge information and solutions are available on the `Challenge website <https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2873386/wiki/>`_ on Sage Bionetwork's Synapse Platform.

Reddit comments üí¨
==================

**Description:** A constantly updated dataset of *every* comment posted on reddit since the site's inception in 2005, totalling at more than 1.7 *billion* comments. You can read about the origin of the dataset `here <https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7/i_have_every_publicly_available_reddit_comment/>`_, and about the way it is stored in Google BigQuery `here <https://www.reddit.com/r/bigquery/comments/3cej2b/17_billion_reddit_comments_loaded_on_bigquery/>`_.

**Link:** https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/dataset/fh-bigquery:reddit_comments

**Project ideas:** 

- What makes a reddit comment popular (i.e. get a high score)? Find correlation to time posted and content: Do late comments still have a chance to be popular? Do short comments fair better than long ones? Are there any specific words or terms that boost a post's score?
- Automatically generate an average, or a popular, reddit comment given a reddit link and the comments already posted on its thread.
- Find correlation between real world events and reddit comments: What events do the reddit community respond to more? What types of events elicit a quick but short response and what types bring about a long response continuing for days or weeks?
-  Find communities and sub-communities, discover leaders or trend-setter within them and visualize how they are formed.


Stack Exchange üî∑
==================

The New York Times Articles üì∞
==============================

**Description:** The New York Times is one of the most wide read newspapers around the world. It has articles about world and local news, opinions, and various other topics. Using these APIs you can access any article since 1851, books, comments and many more. Bare in mind that the access is with a key which is restricted. In the articles API, for examples, you are restricted to 10 calls per second, and 10,000 per day. The restrictions are specified `here <http://developer.nytimes.com/apps/register>`_.

**Data format:** The access to the data is by a web based API - you send a GET request and get back a json with the data. Here are some `examples <http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/read/article_search_api_v2#examples>`_ (there are examples for all of the available APIs). There is also a GUI `API console <http://developer.nytimes.com/io-docs>`_.

**Overview:** http://developer.nytimes.com/docs

**Project ideas:** 

- Identify the topics a reporter usually writes on, and predict the writer of an article by it's content, or even who will cover some specific event.
- Compare coverage with factual data: do similar events get the same coverage?
