Open Israeli Municipal Budgets üèò
=================================

**Description:** Open local budget is a project under The Public Knowledge Workshop aimed at making local authorities budgets accessible to the public. While the project is at beta, many budgets are already online (some in a more accessible format than others) browsable, though a single budget at a time, in the `project's home page <http://www.omuni.org/>`_. Being in beta means that there is plenty of room for improvement - this is where you can come in!

**Project ideas:** 

- How can we compare between budgets of different municipalities or of the same municipality but in different years? And how can such a comparison be visualized?
- Given a budget can we understand how it is invested geographically/demographically? Moreover, can we derive how a given municipality invests the money it got from taxes/arnona in proportion to the amount payed by each region in the city?
- Generalize the above two ideas into a tool that is able to take complex queries and produce meaningful results (not necesarily visualized).
